# AWS-Website-to-query-data
This is an ETL Project
Aim to create a simple yet working website, where one can write queries and the webpage would display results in tabular form
The website would also give you the option to choose the database
I am using Amazon EC2 as a server
The data would initially be store in Amazon S2
For RDBMS, I used Amazon RDS as MySQL database
I again use the same MySQL database in AWS Redshift - I did this to check the difference in execution time, if any
Transform the existing SQL database to a NoSQL DB and store it in MongoDB
Backend Coding in Python Frontend Coding in HTML, JavaScript Framework used is Flask


STEPS - 
1. LAUNCH A AMAZON EC2 INSTANCE
2. DONWLOAD THE SSH KEY FROM AMAZON
3. DOWNLOAD PUTTY AND PUTTY-GEN APPLICATIONS ON WINDOWS
4. USE PUTTY-GEN TO GENERATE A PUTTY RECOGNIZED KEY FROM THE AMAZON SSH KEY
5. USE THE NEW GENERATED KEY TO CONNECT TO THE EC2 INSTANCE FROM PUTTY
